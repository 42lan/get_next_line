# get_next_line
The aim of this project is to make me code a function that returns a line ending with a newline, read from a file descriptor

### Objectives:
This project will not only allow me to add a very convenient function to my collection, but it will also allow me to learn a highly interesting new concept in C programming: static variables.
I'll also gain a deeper understanding of allocations, whether they happen on the stack memory or in the heap memory, the manipulation and the life cycle of a buffer, the unexpected complexity implied in the use of one or many static variables.<br /><br />My respect of the Norm will improve the rigor of my programming. I also suspect that my approach to coding will change when I will discover that the initial state of a variable in a function can vary depending on the call of that very function.
